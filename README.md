# Error-Correction-Coding-and-Interleaver-Decoding
This project involves the implementation of error-correction codes and the application of interleaving techniques to improve the reliability of communication systems in the presence of errors. The main tasks include generating codewords based on a given generator matrix, analyzing the parameters of the code (n, k), and calculating the weight of each codeword. The project also involves generating random information words, forming codewords, and simulating error correction processes through interleaving and deinterleaving.
