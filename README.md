# Error-Correction-Coding-and-Interleaver-Decoding
This project implements error correction coding using a generator matrix, analyzes code parameters (n, k), and calculates codeword weights. It also applies interleaving and deinterleaving techniques to correct errors, simulates a communication channel, and compares transmitted vs. received sequences.
